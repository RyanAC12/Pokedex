# Pokedex
Functional Pokedex using PokeAPI

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for and view information about different Pokemon using PokeAPI.


Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.


Usage

To use the application, enter the number of the Pokemon you would like to search for in the green input field and click the black button to the left of the input box. 
The app will retrieve data about the Pokemon (name, height, weight, and type(s)) and display it on the Pokedex.
To search for another Pokemon, just type and enter the next number and a new result will appear.


Shiny Pokemon Feature

In addition to the normal sprites, there is a feature where there is a 0.5% chance that a shiny sprite will appear upon search.


Acknowledgements
